# C_Basic_Utility
This GitHub repository, "C_BasicUtilities," contains two C programs, each focusing on basic but essential functionalities in C programming. These programs serve as practical exercises in fundamental C programming concepts and controls.

### Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter (c_to_f.c): 
This program is a straightforward tool for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, following the formula celsius * 1.8 = fahrenheit - 32. The user is prompted to input a Celsius value, which is then converted to Fahrenheit using a dedicated function. The program additionally outputs weather-related statements based on the Fahrenheit temperature, according to predefined temperature ranges. This program is not just a demonstration of basic arithmetic and input/output in C, but also includes conditional statements and function usage.

### String Repeater (string_repeater.c): 
This program takes two command-line arguments: a non-negative number and a single-line string. It prints the provided string on the screen the specified number of times. Key aspects of this program include validating the number of arguments, ensuring the first argument is a non-negative number, and converting a string representation of a number into an integer using strtol() for safer error handling. This exercise underlines the importance of input validation, loop control, and safe conversion practices in C programming.
